## Determining Salt concentration for the brine mixture
The concentration for the brine mixture was determined in terms of molality (b) so that it can
be related according to the freezing point suppression equation to find the cryoscopic constant
of water (𝐾f)
𝑀𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑏) = 𝑀𝑜𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑡𝑒 (𝑚𝑜𝑙) / 𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡 (𝑘𝑔)
The calculations can be seen in 8.1 Molality Calculation. For the brine solution with 30g of salt and 300ml of water, the molality was found to be 1.711 mol NaCl/kg water

## Experimental Procedure
A salt solution was prepared using 30g of table salt and 300ml of water measured perfectly. The circuit was arranged as shown in Figure 1 and as explained in 2.2 Circuit arrangement. The RTD should not come in direct contact with water as the 5V power supply can split up water molecules leading to an additional pathway for current flow. If the RTD comes in contact with water, the readings would be incorrect.
RTD connected with the terminal block was enclosed inside a thin plastic bag and then immersed in the salt solution. This setup was allowed to freeze altogether for several hours. Once the water froze completely, the setup was removed from the freezer. The wires connected to the terminal block were plugged into the breadboard and the code was run to get the temperature and time values. The sleep time for the system was 60 seconds. So, data was collected every 1 minute for 175 minutes The data were plotted in Excel as a Temperature v/s Time plot.
A plot between the temperature and molality was plotted on a graph. Further calculations are in the Results & Discussion.
